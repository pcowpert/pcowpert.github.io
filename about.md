**Important Note:** I am currently in the process of moving from Boston to Pasadena, and do not yet have complete contact information at Carnegie. Everything will be updated ASAP, but until then please contact me via e-mail.

I am a NASA Hubble Postdoctoral Fellow at Carnegie Observatories in Pasadena, California.  I work primarily in the emerging new field of joint gravitational wave (GW) and electromagnetic (EM) astronomy. My research focuses on everything from survey design to executing optical/NIR follow-up of GW triggers from LIGO, to modeling of the optical/NIR counterpart. Prior to my time at Carnegie, I earned my doctorate from Harvard Astronomy under the advisement of Prof. Edo Berger and my undergraduate degree from University of Maryland - College Park, where I worked with Chris Reynolds on various observational and theoretical aspects of accretion disks.

In a previous life I was a filmmaker and photographer, working in and around Baltimore, MD and Washington D.C.
