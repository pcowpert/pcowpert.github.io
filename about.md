I am a NASA Hubble Postdoctoral Fellow at Carnegie Observatories in Pasadena, California.  I work primarily in the emerging new field of joint gravitational wave (GW) and electromagnetic (EM) astronomy. My research focuses on everything from survey design to executing optical/NIR follow-up of GW triggers from LIGO, to modeling of the optical/NIR counterpart. Prior to my time at Carnegie, I earned my doctorate in astronomy from Harvard University under the advisement of Prof. Edo Berger and my undergraduate degree from University of Maryland - College Park, where I worked with Chris Reynolds on various observational and theoretical aspects of accretion disks.

In a previous life I was a filmmaker and photographer, working in and around Baltimore, MD and Washington D.C.
