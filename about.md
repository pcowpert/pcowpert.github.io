I am a finishing graduate student who works in the emerging new field of joint gravitational wave (GW) and electromagnetic (EM) astronomy. My research focuses on everything from survey design to executing optical/NIR follow-up of GW triggers from LIGO, to modeling of the optical/NIR counterpart. Prior to my time at Harvard, I earned my undergraduate degree from University of Maryland - College Park, where I worked with Chris Reynolds on various observational and theoretical aspects of accretion disks. Starting in the Fall of 2018, I will be moving to Carnegie Observatories in Pasadena,CA as a Hubble Fellow. 

In a previous life I was a filmmaker and photographer, working in and around Baltimore, MD and Washington D.C.
