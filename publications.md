<!-- Peter Williams' HTML template for a publications list

Unlike the LaTeX template, I can't use variables to parametrize my name and
info. I've marked text that needs updating with "XXX" comments.

Note that this list looks significantly different than the PDF publication
list. I feel that on the web it makes sense to take a different approach.

I also haven't spent as much time beautifying this page as I have the LaTeX
templates. My actual publication list is embedded in a Wordpress site that
does a bunch of the CSS fanciness automatically, and it'd be a lot of work to
extract all of that magic. -->




This publication list was generated using the amazing [worklog-tools](https://github.com/pkgw/worklog-tools/) and associated html/PDF templates created by [Peter K. G. Williams](https://newton.cx/~peter/). Check out his amazing contributions to scientific software!
