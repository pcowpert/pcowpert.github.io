Research Interests
------------------
+ Electromagnetic follow-up of gravitational wave events from Advanced LIGO and VIRGO.
+ Theoretical modeling of optical transients associated with binary neutron star mergers  (e.g., kilonovae).
+ General time-domain astrophysics: contamination in optical surveys, survey design and optimization, rapid timescale transients.
+ Large-scale astronomy image processing and pipeline development for surveys.
