I am a fifth-year graduate student at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. I work with Professsor Edo Berger and the Berger on several aspects of time-domain astronomy. My research is primarily focused on the follow-up of gravitational wave events detected by the Advanced LIGO and VIRGO interferometers using traditional optical telescopes. In the past, I've worked on observational and theoretical topics in X-Ray astronomy and AGN physics.

Prior to grad school, I had a whole host of hobbies I hope to return to someday including: photography, martial arts, and playing the drums.
